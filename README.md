# R programming inception

The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing
statistical software and data analysis. In the process of learning R, I have written
this inception documentation or cheatsheet, whatever you want to call. I am learning from
Datacamp. For each course in Datacamp, there is a separate markdown file, with the filename
same as course name. If I learn something from outside Datacamp, I shall add it to miscellaneous folder.
